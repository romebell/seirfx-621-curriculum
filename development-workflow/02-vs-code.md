# What is VS Code?

*VS Code* is a popular open-source text-editor maintained by Microsoft. It's very customizable and capable. VS Code's functionality can be extended using *extensions*, however, most useful features are built-in. To try it out, let's use VS Code to open and edit a file!

# Edit a File in VS Code

To edit a specific file in VS Code, we can simply type the filename after `code`.

Let's add an *alias* (shortcut) command that will change to your code directory by simply typing `repo`. We can do this by editing the hidden `.zshrc` file.

```bash
code ~/.zshrc
```

Add this line (preferably near the example aliases).

```
alias fx1026="cd ~/seirfx1026"
```

# Extensions

## Themes

Developers love making their workspace their own - one way to do this is through VS Code themes. Here's a few from the marketplace that come highly recommended:

- [One Dark Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme)
- [One Dark Monokai](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=azemoh.one-monokai)
- [Dracula](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula)
- [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme)
- [SynthWave '84](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode)

You can change your theme by pressing `Command âŒ˜` + `Shift` + `P` in macOS or `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` on Linux and Windows to open the command palette. With the control palette open type `theme` and select the **Preferences: Color Theme** option. From here select the theme you want to apply. Many themes come with VS Code by default, one of the best of which is the **High Contrast Theme**.

# Accessing the Command Line Interface in VS Code

We are able to start a terminal session from within VS Code! This is incredibly useful because it means we can stay in one application and do all our work instead of switching back and forth between VS Code and the Terminal applications. To do this use `Ctrl` + ``` (that is a backtick - this key is above your `Tab` key).

# Test Your Alias

Before we wrap up we should test the alias we made earlier! Close VS Code and the Terminal window. Then re-launch Terminal and type `fx1026` to check that it works!
