### Origin of this Gitbook

Due to the changing nature of course delivery format in response to COVID-19, this course is only offered remotely at this time, and the student pool spans multiple campuses. This version of the notes is tailored for the SEI 59. It will be a working set of documents as SEI instructors continually adapt this originally campus-driven curriculum for the new demands of work-from-home life. The idea is to front-load each day with lessons in the morning, leaving the majority of the afternoon for flexibe workshop/lab time.
